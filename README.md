# 🏥 Medical Data History – SQL Project

A relational database project based on real-world medical records including **patients, doctors, admissions, and provinces**, containing 34 SQL tasks covering **DDL, DML, Joins, Aggregate functions, String functions, Window logic, GROUP BY, HAVING, CASE, etc.**

This project was completed during my **internship at Datamites** as part of practical database handling and SQL query development learning.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Component | Used |
|---------|-------|
| Database | MySQL |
| Language | SQL |
| Files Included | CSV datasets + SQL query file |

## 📊 Dataset Overview

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `patients` | Patient personal details (name, age, height, weight, allergies, etc.) |
| `doctors` | Medical practitioners and their specialties |
| `admissions` | Diagnosis & admission history |
| `province_names` | Province/region lookup table |

## 🧩 ER Diagram

The Entity–Relationship (ER) diagram below shows how the tables are connected in the **Medical Data History** database.

Note: In the admissions table, the column attending_doctor_id is treated as doctor_id to join with the doctors table.

## 🔍 Key SQL Learning Areas

- Filtering (WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE)

- Aggregations (COUNT, SUM, MAX, MIN)

- GROUP BY & HAVING conditions

- String functions (CONCAT, UPPER, LOWER, etc.)

- Joins for relational mapping

- Data cleaning (NULL handling + updates)

- Conditional logic using CASE

- BMI & obesity classification

---

## 📌 Project Tasks Overview

All 34 SQL tasks solved inside: Medical_Data_History.sql

Example Types of Queries Solved:

- Filter male patients

- Handle NULL allergies

- Join patients with provinces

- Count admissions and group by diagnosis

- Group cities by patient count

- Identify obese patients using BMI

- Find unique first names

- Detect repeat diagnosis admissions

---

## 🏆 Sample Query Snippets

### - Highest height patient

select first_name, last_name, height 
from patients 
order by height desc 
limit 1;

### - Patients diagnosed with Dementia

select distinct p.patient_id , p.first_name , p.last_name, a.diagnosis
from patients as p 
join admissions as a 
on p.patient_id = a.patient_id 
where a.diagnosis = 'Dementia';

### - BMI-based obesity classification

select patient_id, weight, height,
case when (weight / power(height / 100, 2)) >= 30 then 1 else 0 end as isObese 
from patients;

## 🚀 How to Run
### 1. Create database & open MySQL
mysql -u root -p

### 2. (Optional) Create database
CREATE DATABASE project_medical_data_history;

USE project_medical_data_history;

### 3. Import SQL file
source Medical_Data_History.sql;

### 4. Load CSV Files into corresponding tables
(via MySQL Workbench or LOAD DATA INFILE)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
Create Power BI or Tableau dashboard

Build stored procedures / triggers

Convert to mini-web app with Flask / Streamlit / Node

Add automated data validation checks
